# Key Prompts Used

## Required Initial Prompt
"You are a junior engineer helping me complete an internship assignment.
The assignment is to reverse engineer Splitwise, scope a realistic 3-day version,
and build a working deployed app.
Important instructions:
1. Do not assume product requirements.
2. Do not jump directly into implementation.
3. Ask me detailed questions about product scope, UX, workflows, edge cases, and engineering decisions.
4. Ask about every implementation detail needed to build the app.
5. After each answer I give, update a Markdown file called AI_CONTEXT.md.
6. AI_CONTEXT.md must become the source of truth for the entire project.
7. The final app must be buildable from AI_CONTEXT.md.
8. Another evaluator should be able to paste AI_CONTEXT.md into the same AI tool and recreate a similar app.
9. Before writing code, produce a build plan based only on the agreed context.
10. During implementation, keep updating AI_CONTEXT.md whenever requirements, architecture, schema, UI, or logic changes.
11. Do not recommend technical solutions. Your job is to let me think through the technical solution.
Start by interviewing me.
Ask questions across:
- product goals
- Splitwise research
- core workflows
- user personas
- MVP scope
- out-of-scope features
- data model !IMPORTANT!
- authentication
- groups
- expenses
- settlements
- balance calculation
- UI screens
- routing
- frontend architecture
- backend architecture
- database choice
- API design
- deployment
- testing
- known risks
- tradeoffs
Do not give me a final plan until you have asked enough questions."

## Follow-up Prompt Themes Used
- Finalize MVP behavior for groups, expenses, splits, balances, settlements, and chat.
- Freeze technical stack decisions (FastAPI + React + relational DB + REST).
- Convert interview decisions into BUILD_PLAN.md and AI_CONTEXT.md.
- Implement backend-first, then frontend routes/pages, then integration and smoke tests.
- Keep AI_CONTEXT.md updated with implementation changes and known limitations.
